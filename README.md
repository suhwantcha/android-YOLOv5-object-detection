### YOLOv5 Product Detection App

This Android app uses your camera to identify over **1,000 products** like snacks, drinks, and cup noodles. It recognizes the **largest item in view**—whether you show the front or back—and **announces its name aloud**.

This project is a modified version of the [TFLite-Object-Detection-Android-App-Tutorial-Using-YOLOv5](https://github.com/AarohiSingla/TFLite-Object-Detection-Android-App-Tutorial-Using-YOLOv5) repository. It's powered by a **YOLOv5 model** converted to `.tflite` for mobile use.
